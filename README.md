Clean-archtecture

chapter 1 -
The low-level details and the high-level structure
are all part of the same whole. They form a continuous fabric that defines the shape
of the system. You canâ€™t have one without the other; indeed, no clear dividing line
separates them. There is simply a continuum of decisions from the highest to the
lowest levels.
The Goal - The goal of software architecture is to minimize the human resources required to build and
maintain the required system.

chapter 3 Paradigm Overview
Each of the three programming paradigms removes capabilities from the programmer. Eache imposes some kind of extra discipline that is negative in its intent. Paradigms of programming have everything to do with Archtecture. We use polymorphism as the mechanism to cross architectural limits(boundaries); we use functional programming to impose discipline on the location of and access to data; and we use structured programming as the algorithimic foundation of out modules.
